🧑‍💻 Aspiring Software Engineer
Hi, I'm Vladyslav Sklema, a third-year Computer Science student with a deep interest in software development, algorithms, and the theoretical aspects of computing. While I haven’t worked in the industry yet, I actively enhance my skills through hands-on coding projects and self-guided learning.

🚀 Current Projects:
– Algorithms & Data Structures – implementing and optimizing a wide range of algorithmic solutions with a focus on performance and clarity.
– Machine Learning – learning the foundations of ML, including supervised/unsupervised learning, and applying tools like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
– Embeddings – exploring vector representations of data, especially in the context of natural language processing and semantic search.

📚 Currently Learning:
Machine Learning • Embeddings • Data Science • Compiler Theory • Math for AI
